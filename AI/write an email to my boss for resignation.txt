Dear [Boss Name], 

I am writing to inform you of my decision to resign from my position as [Job Title] at [Company Name] effective [Date of Departure]. This was not an easy decision to make, but I feel that the time is right for me to move onto the next stage in my career. 

I wanted to ensure that my resignation was in line with the company's expectations, and that I was giving them adequate notice. I've appreciated the opportunities I've had throughout my time here and I genuinely believe that our work together has been much more than just a job. 

I am willing to do whatever I can to make this transition as smooth and successful as possible. Please let me know if there is any additional information or paperwork that I need to complete. I hope that there will not be any bad blood between us now or in the future. 

I will miss my colleagues and all the friends I've made here over the years. Thank you for your support and guidance throughout my time here. 

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
